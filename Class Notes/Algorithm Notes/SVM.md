#Support Vector Machines (SVM)
##What data problem does it solve?

* Classification or regressions, supervised
* Discriminate, splitting is the goal 

##How do we evaluate performance?

* Classification: Number of correctly predicted targets (accuracy)
* Regressions: R-squared

##What is the output?

A multi-dimensional hyperplane splitting the data into distinct categories

##What is interpretable of the algorithm?

Plot visually to verify if splits make sense (e.g. do they have coherence within sets)

##How is it prone to overfitting?

High error tolerance

##How is it customizable?

* C : Error tolerance (higher C, lower tolerance)
* Kernels: Linear, Poly or RBF
