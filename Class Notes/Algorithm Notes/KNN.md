#K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
##What data problem does it solve?

* Classification, supervised
* Generative, looks for similar data points

##How do we evaluate performance?

* Number of correctly predicted targets (accuracy)
* R-squared, mean squared error when regressing

##What is the output?

Solves for similarity based on distance and number of neighbors.

##What is interpretable of the algorithm?

Plot data do see if classifications visually make sense.

##How is it prone to overfitting?

Too many neighbors, therefore everything looks alike.

##How is it customizable?

* K: the number of neighbors to consider
* Distances: Minkowski (Manhattan or Euclid), Jaccad
