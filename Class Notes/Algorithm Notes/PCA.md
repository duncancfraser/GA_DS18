##What data problem does it solve?

* Helpful with dealing with colinearity, or related featuress, unsupervised.
* Emphasizes variation.

##How do we evaluate performance?

* Component's correlation with original variable.
* How much explanatory power does each principle component have?   

##What is the output?

Components (Principal, Secondary, Tertiary)

##What is interpretable of the algorithm?

Explanatory power of the principle component

##How is it prone to overfitting?

Running PCA on a large scale data set with many missing values.

##How is it customizable?
