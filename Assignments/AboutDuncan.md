#About Me: Duncan Fraser

**What do you do?** 

I am currently an analyst at [Crossix](http://crossix.com)  I also enjoy biking, good movies, Boston sports, and cooking.

**What data interests you?**

* Through my job I've worked with healthcare marketing data including:
  * Rx transactions
  * HCP and Physician info
  * Various marketing activity and exposure data: 
    * CRM Databases, Digital and TV Ad Exposure, Print
* Additionally I'm interested in this stuff:
  * City and Travel
  * TV and Film
  * Sports 
  * Restaurants and Food

**Why GA Data Science?**

 I'm part of a company that sells analytics products and services to help businesses improve decision making. So that's given me exposure to the BI and analytical parts of data science. However, we work mostly with a proprietary tool... erm, *SafeMine, anyone?* 

 To answer the question: I really haven't been exposed to the broader tools and techniques out in the data science universe.  I see this class as an opportunity to familiarize myself with python, work on a cool project of my choice and get some exposure to machine learning.  Plus who doesn't love to learn?
