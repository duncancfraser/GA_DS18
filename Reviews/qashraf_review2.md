#Peer Review Project 2

**Reviewer:** Duncan Fraser 

**Reviewee:** Qasim 

[Qasim's project](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/qashraf/GA_DS/blob/master/project/Project2_final.ipynb) seeks to predict . 

##Project Strengths

* Project incorporates more advanced modeling and optimization techniques, not yet covered in the course. 
* Overall, the project demonstrates a high level of technical and mathematically proficiency.
* Nice job identifying and removing erroneous, confusing data.
* I liked your use of confusion matrices.

##Areas for Improvement 

* A little more explanation would help clarify why you're taking the steps you take, especially for the feature selection and model building sections of the notebook.

##Clarification Questions

* What exactly does a 311 call mean?  Would be helpful to clarify what this data is upfront.
* Not clear what all these departments are, perhaps a key or updated legends would make this clearer.

##Code Review

* Nice work here, the code is sophisticated. 

##Next Steps

* As you work to get a working model, I think adding some clearer structure and re-reviewing your explanations would help clarify what you're doing.
* Can you bring in any outside datasets to enrich the predictive ability of your model? 
* Perhaps you need to balance the data in order to improve it's ability to predict?
