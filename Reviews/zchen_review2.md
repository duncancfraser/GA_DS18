[Zach's project](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/zachzeyuchen/ga-data-science/blob/master/NB/Project2.ipynb) seeks to interpolate missing values for if an establishment is kid friendly. 

##Project Strengths

* Great choice of data set and an interesting problem to try to solve.
* Nice overview of the datasets used and the Yelp social network.


##Areas for Improvement 

* Setting a baseline using a minimum effort model would help to show how your feature selection and cleaning improved model accuracy.
* Similarly, showing how different features improve the model would help show feature importance and validate feature selection decisions. 
* Consider a bit more visualization of the data, and explanations when looking at AUC plots.

##Clarification Questions

* Why did you choose the sample size you did?

##Code Review

* Code is clear and concise. 

##Next Steps

* Could you create binary features based on optional data to improve accuracy (e.g. a 1 for a filled out field and a 0 for a null one)?
