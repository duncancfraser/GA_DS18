#Peer Review Project 1
Reviewer: Duncan Fraser 

Reviewee: Houston Predieri

[Houston's project](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/hpredieri/gassign/blob/master/tickets_final.ipynb) focuses on NBA ticket prices.  

##Project Strengths

* You use some clever code to customize the dataset and flag different features.
* 

##Areas for Improvement 

* Overall structure could be a bit more organized. 
* Some of the line graphs were very difficult to interpret.
* Is there a way to pull out team names for ballgames and split into two columns (home and away)?  It might create opportunities for more robust analysis.

##Clarification Questions

* Is there a way to translate the venue id back into venue names?
