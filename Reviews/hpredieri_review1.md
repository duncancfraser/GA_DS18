#Peer Review Project 1

**Reviewer:** Duncan Fraser 

**Reviewee:** Houston Predieri

[Houston's project](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/hpredieri/gassign/blob/master/tickets_final.ipynb) focuses on NBA ticket prices.  

##Project Strengths

* You use clever python, creating functions and using for loops.
* You do a good job splitting, cleaning and customizing the dataset to allow you to look at different subsets.

##Areas for Improvement 

* Overall structure could be a bit more organized.
* Some of the line graphs were very difficult to interpret.


##Clarification Questions

* Is there a way to translate the venue id back into venue names?

##Code Review

* Code is pretty strong overall. Some additional comments on specifics of what you're doing would make it clearer to the reader.

##Next Steps

* Is there a way to pull out team names for ballgames and split into two columns (home and away)?  It might create opportunities for more robust analysis.
* Though not your focus, I think an analysis of how sports and non-sports events differed could be very interesting.
