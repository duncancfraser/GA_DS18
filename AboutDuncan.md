#About Me: Duncan Fraser

**Day job:** Analyst at <a href=http://crossix.com/>Crossix</a>

**Data:**

- Data I've worked with through my job:
  * Rx transactions

    * CRM, Digital Ads, TV exposure, Print
  * HCP and Physician data
- Other data I'm interested in:
  * City and Travel
  * TV and Film
  * Sports 
  * Restaurants and Food

**Why GA Data Science?**

  I have great exposure to the power of data through my work, but not many of the widely used tools and techniques.  I see this class as an opportunity to familiarize myself with python as well as get some exposure to the Machine Learning aspect of Data Science.  Plus who doesn't love to learn?
