#About Me: Duncan Fraser

**What do you do?** 

I am currently an analyst at <a href=http://crossix.com/>Crossix</a>.  I also enjoy biking, good movies, Boston sports, and cooking.

**What data interests you?**

- Through my job I've worked with healthcare marketing data including:
  * Rx transactions
  * HCP and Physician info
  * Various marketing activity and exposure data: 
    * CRM Databases, Digital and TV Ad Exposure, Print
- Additionally I'm interested in this stuff:
  * City and Travel
  * TV and Film
  * Sports 
  * Restaurants and Food

**Why GA Data Science?**

 Through work, I've been exposed to how businesses use data to improve decision making. However, we work mostly with a proprietary tool... erm, *SafeMine, anyone?* 

 To answer the question: I really haven't been exposed to the broader tools and techniques out in the data science universe.  I see this class as an opportunity to familiarize myself with python, work on a cool project of my choice and get some exposure to machine learning.  Plus who doesn't love to learn?
