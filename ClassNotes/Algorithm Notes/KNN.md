#K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
##What data problem does it solve?

Classification. Generative, looks for similar data points. Supervised.

##How do we evaluate performance?

Number of correctly predicted targets (accuracy)

R-squared, mean squared error when regressing.

##What is the output?

Solves for similarity based on distance and number of neighbors.

##What is interpretable of the algorithm?

Can plot data do see if classifications visually make sense

##How is it prone to overfitting?

Too many neighbors and everything looks alike

##How is it customizable?

* K: the number of neighbors to consider
* Distances: Minkowski (Manhattan or Euclid), Jaccad
