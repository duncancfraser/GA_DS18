#Support Vector Machines (SVM)
##What data problem does it solve?

Classification or regressions. Discriminate, splitting is the goal. Supervised

##How do we evaluate performance?

* Classification: Number of correctly predicted targets (accuracy)
* Regressions: R-squared


##What is the output?

A multi-dimensional hyperplane splitting the data into distinct categories

##What is interpretable of the algorithm?

Can see if visually the splits make sense (e.g. do they have coherence within sets)

##How is it prone to overfitting?

*  High error tolerance

##How is it customizable?

* C : Error tolerance (higher C, lower tolerance)
* Kernels: Linear, Poly or RBF
