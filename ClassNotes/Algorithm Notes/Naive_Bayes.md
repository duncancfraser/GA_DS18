#Naive Bayes
#--------------

##What data problem does it solve?

Classification, supervised learning problem.
Predicting, especially with smaller data-sets, but a bad estimator.

##How do we evaluate performance performance

##What is the output?

'Bayes coefficient' - probability of feature showing up, given a target variable (opposite of logistic regression)

##What is interpretable of the algorithm?

##How is it prone to overfitting?

##How is it customizable?

* Bernoulli: based on presence (binomial) 
* Multinomial: counting approach
